-- 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
-- 	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
-- 	If the name of the shell contains a space, you might need to enclose

-- 							*shell-unquoting*
-- 	Rules regarding quotes:
-- 	1. Option is split on space and tab characters that are not inside
-- 	   quotes: "abc def" runs shell named "abc" with additional argument
-- 	   "def", '"abc def"' runs shell named "abc def" with no additional
-- 	   arguments (here and below: additional means “additional to
-- 	   'shellcmdflag'”).
-- 	2. Quotes in option may be present in any position and any number:
-- 	   '"abc"', '"a"bc', 'a"b"c', 'ab"c"' and '"a"b"c"' are all equivalent
-- 	   to just "abc".
-- 	3. Inside quotes backslash preceding backslash means one backslash.
-- 	   Backslash preceding quote means one quote. Backslash preceding
-- 	   anything else means backslash and next character literally:
-- 	   '"a\\b"' is the same as "a\b", '"a\\"b"' runs shell named literally
-- 	   'a"b', '"a\b"' is the same as "a\b" again.
-- 	4. Outside of quotes backslash always means itself, it cannot be used
-- 	   to escape quote: 'a\"b"' is the same as "a\b".
-- 	Note that such processing is done after |:set| did its own round of
-- 	unescaping, so to keep yourself sane use |:let-&| like shown above.

-- 	"dh".  If you use this, you may also want to use the mapping
-- 	":map <BS> X" to make backspace delete the character in front of the

-- 		letter.  Thus "KEEPTHIS and "K_L_M" are stored, but "KeepThis"
-- 		and "_K_L_M" are not.  Nested List and Dict items may not be
-- 		read back correctly, you end up with an empty item.
-- 							*viminfo-quote*
-- 	"	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  Old name of
-- 		the '<' item, with the disadvantage that you need to put a
-- 		backslash before the ", otherwise it will be recognized as the
-- 		start of a comment!
-- 							*viminfo-%*
-- 	%	When included, save and restore the buffer list.  If Vim is
-- 		started with a file name argument, the buffer list is not
-- 		restored.  If Vim is started without a file name argument, the
-- 		buffer list is restored from the viminfo file.  Quickfix
-- 		('buftype'), unlisted ('buflisted'), unnamed and buffers on
-- 		removable media (|viminfo-r|) are not saved.
-- 		When followed by a number, the number specifies the maximum
-- 		number of buffers that are stored.  Without a number all
-- 		buffers are stored.
-- 							*viminfo-'*
-- 	'	Maximum number of previously edited files for which the marks
-- 		are remembered.  This parameter must always be included when
-- 		'viminfo' is non-empty.
-- 		Including this item also means that the |jumplist| and the
-- 		|changelist| are stored in the viminfo file.
-- 							*viminfo-/*
-- 	/	Maximum number of items in the search pattern history to be
-- 		saved.  If non-zero, then the previous search and substitute
-- 		patterns are also saved.  When not included, the value of
-- 		'history' is used.
-- 							*viminfo-:*
-- 	:	Maximum number of items in the command-line history to be
-- 		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
-- 							*viminfo-<*
-- 	<	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  If zero then
-- 		registers are not saved.  When not included, all lines are
-- 		saved.  '"' is the old name for this item.
-- 		Also see the 's' item below: limit specified in Kbyte.
-- 							*viminfo-@*
-- 	@	Maximum number of items in the input-line history to be
-- 		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
-- 							*viminfo-c*
-- 	c	When included, convert the text in the viminfo file from the
-- 		'encoding' used when writing the file to the current
-- 		'encoding'.  See |viminfo-encoding|.
-- 							*viminfo-f*
-- 	f	Whether file marks need to be stored.  If zero, file marks ('0
-- 		to '9, 'A to 'Z) are not stored.  When not present or when
-- 		non-zero, they are all stored.  '0 is used for the current
-- 		cursor position (when exiting or when doing ":wviminfo").
-- 							*viminfo-h*
-- 	h	Disable the effect of 'hlsearch' when loading the viminfo
-- 		file.  When not included, it depends on whether ":nohlsearch"
-- 		has been used since the last search command.
-- 							*viminfo-n*
-- 	n	Name of the viminfo file.  The name must immediately follow
-- 		the 'n'.  Must be at the end of the option!  If the
-- 		'viminfofile' option is set, that file name overrides the one
-- 		given here with 'viminfo'.  Environment variables are
-- 		expanded when opening the file, not when setting the option.
-- 							*viminfo-r*
-- 	r	Removable media.  The argument is a string (up to the next
-- 		',').  This parameter can be given several times.  Each
-- 		specifies the start of a path for which no marks will be
-- 		stored.  This is to avoid removable media.  For MS-DOS you
-- 		could use "ra:,rb:", for Amiga "rdf0:,rdf1:,rdf2:".  You can
-- 		also use it for temp files, e.g., for Unix: "r/tmp".  Case is
-- 		ignored.  Maximum length of each 'r' argument is 50
-- 		characters.
-- 							*viminfo-s*
-- 	s	Maximum size of an item in Kbyte.  If zero then registers are
-- 		not saved.  Currently only applies to registers.  The default
-- 		"s10" will exclude registers with more than 10 Kbyte of text.
-- 		Also see the '<' item above: line count limit.

-- string	(default "^\s*#\s*include")
-- 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
-- 	Pattern to be used to find an include command.  It is a search
-- 	pattern, just like for the "/" command (See |pattern|).  The default
-- 	value is for C programs.  This option is used for the commands "[i",
-- 	"]I", "[d", etc.
-- 	Normally the 'isfname' option is used to recognize the file name that
-- 	comes after the matched pattern.  But if "\zs" appears in the pattern
-- 	then the text matched from "\zs" to the end, or until "\ze" if it
-- 	appears, is used as the file name.  Use this to include characters
-- 	that are not in 'isfname', such as a space.  You can then use
-- 	'includeexpr' to process the matched text.
-- 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
vim.o.include = "^\\s*#\\s*include"
-- number	(default 2)
-- 			global
-- 	Threshold for reporting number of lines changed.  When the number of
-- 	changed lines is more than 'report' a message will be given for most
-- 	":" commands.  If you want it always, set 'report' to 0.
-- 	For the ":substitute" command the number of substitutions is used
-- 	instead of the number of lines.
vim.o.report = "2"
-- string	(default "n-v-c-sm:block,i-ci-ve:ver25,r-cr-o:hor20")
-- 			global
-- 	Configures the cursor style for each mode. Works in the GUI and many
-- 	terminals.  See |tui-cursor-shape|.
vim.o.guicursor = "n-v-c-sm:block,i-ci-ve:ver25,r-cr-o:hor20"
-- number	(default 1)
-- 			global
-- 	Minimal number of lines to scroll when the cursor gets off the
-- 	screen (e.g., with "j").  Not used for scroll commands (e.g., CTRL-E,
-- 	CTRL-D).  Useful if your terminal scrolls very slowly.
-- 	When set to a negative number from -1 to -100 this is used as the
-- 	percentage of the window height.  Thus -50 scrolls half the window
-- 	height.
vim.o.scrolljump = "1"
-- boolean (default off)
-- 			global
-- 	When 'confirm' is on, certain operations that would normally
-- 	fail because of unsaved changes to a buffer, e.g. ":q" and ":e",
-- 	instead raise a dialog asking if you wish to save the current
-- 	file(s).  You can still use a ! to unconditionally |abandon| a buffer.
-- 	If 'confirm' is off you can still activate confirmation for one
-- 	command only (this is most useful in mappings) with the |:confirm|
-- 	command.
-- 	Also see the |confirm()| function and the 'v' flag in 'guioptions'.
vim.o.confirm = "false"
-- number	(default 4000)
-- 			global
-- 	If this many milliseconds nothing is typed the swap file will be
-- 	written to disk (see |crash-recovery|).  Also used for the
-- 	|CursorHold| autocommand event.
vim.o.updatetime = "4000"
-- string (default: "latin1" or value from $LANG)
-- 			global
-- 	Sets the character encoding used inside Vim.  It applies to text in
-- 	the buffers, registers, Strings in expressions, text stored in the
-- 	viminfo file, etc.  It sets the kind of characters which Vim can work
-- 	with.  See |encoding-names| for the possible values.
vim.o.encoding = "utf-8"
-- string	(default "extend")
-- 			global
-- 	Sets the model to use for the mouse.  The name mostly specifies what
-- 	the right mouse button is used for:
-- 	   extend	Right mouse button extends a selection.  This works
-- 			like in an xterm.
-- 	   popup	Right mouse button pops up a menu.  The shifted left
-- 			mouse button extends a selection.  This works like
-- 			with Microsoft Windows.
-- 	   popup_setpos Like "popup", but the cursor will be moved to the
-- 			position where the mouse was clicked, and thus the
-- 			selected operation will act upon the clicked object.
-- 			If clicking inside a selection, that selection will
-- 			be acted upon, i.e. no cursor move.  This implies of
-- 			course, that right clicking outside a selection will
-- 			end Visual mode.
-- 	Overview of what button does what for each model:
-- 	mouse		    extend		popup(_setpos) ~
-- 	left click	    place cursor	place cursor
-- 	left drag	    start selection	start selection
-- 	shift-left	    search word		extend selection
-- 	right click	    extend selection	popup menu (place cursor)
-- 	right drag	    extend selection	-
-- 	middle click	    paste		paste
