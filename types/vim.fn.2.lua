-- When {expr} is a |List| then this returns the index of the

-- 		Otherwise, {expr} is used as a String.  The result is a
-- 		Number, which gives the index (byte offset) in {expr} where
-- 		{pat} matches.
--
-- 		A match at the first character or |List| item returns zero.
-- 		If there is no match -1 is returned.
--
-- 		For getting submatches see |matchlist()|.
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:echo match("testing", "ing")	" results in 4
-- 			:echo match([1, 'x'], '\a')	" results in 1
-- <		See |string-match| for how {pat} is used.
-- 								*strpbrk()*
-- 		Vim doesn't have a strpbrk() function.  But you can do: >
-- 			:let sepidx = match(line, '[.,;: \t]')
-- <								*strcasestr()*
-- 		Vim doesn't have a strcasestr() function.  But you can add
-- 		"\c" to the pattern to ignore case: >
-- 			:let idx = match(haystack, '\cneedle')
-- <
-- 		If {start} is given, the search starts from byte index
-- 		{start} in a String or item {start} in a |List|.
-- 		The result, however, is still the index counted from the
-- 		first character/item.  Example: >
-- 			:echo match("testing", "ing", 2)
-- <		result is again "4". >
-- 			:echo match("testing", "ing", 4)
-- <		result is again "4". >
-- 			:echo match("testing", "t", 2)
-- <		result is "3".
-- 		For a String, if {start} > 0 then it is like the string starts
-- 		{start} bytes later, thus "^" will match at {start}.  Except
-- 		when {count} is given, then it's like matches before the
-- 		{start} byte are ignored (this is a bit complicated to keep it
-- 		backwards compatible).
-- 		For a String, if {start} < 0, it will be set to 0.  For a list
-- 		the index is counted from the end.
-- 		If {start} is out of range ({start} > strlen({expr}) for a
-- 		String or {start} > len({expr}) for a |List|) -1 is returned.
--
-- 		When {count} is given use the {count}'th match.  When a match
-- 		is found in a String the search for the next one starts one
-- 		character further.  Thus this example results in 1: >
-- 			echo match("testing", "..", 0, 2)
-- <		In a |List| the search continues in the next item.
-- 		Note that when {count} is added the way {start} works changes,
-- 		see above.
--
-- 		See |pattern| for the patterns that are accepted.
-- 		The 'ignorecase' option is used to set the ignore-caseness of
-- 		the pattern.  'smartcase' is NOT used.  The matching is always
-- 		done like 'magic' is set and 'cpoptions' is empty.

-- Stop the {job}.  This can also be used to signal the job.

-- 		terminated forcedly (there is no "gentle" way).
-- 		This goes to the process group, thus children may also be
-- 		affected.
--
-- 		Effect for Unix:
-- 			"term"	 SIGTERM (default)
-- 			"hup"	 SIGHUP
-- 			"quit"	 SIGQUIT
-- 			"int"	 SIGINT
-- 			"kill"	 SIGKILL (strongest way to stop)

-- 			"hup"	 CTRL_BREAK
-- 			"quit"	 CTRL_BREAK
-- 			"int"	 CTRL_C
-- 			"kill"	 terminate process forcedly
-- 			Others	 CTRL_BREAK
--
-- 		On Unix the signal is sent to the process group.  This means
-- 		that when the job is "sh -c command" it affects both the shell
-- 		and the command.
--
-- 		The result is a Number: 1 if the operation could be executed,
-- 		0 if "how" is not supported on the system.
-- 		Note that even when the operation was executed, whether the
-- 		job was actually stopped needs to be checked with
-- 		|job_status()|.
--
-- 		If the status of the job is "dead", the signal will not be
-- 		sent.  This is to avoid to stop the wrong job (esp. on Unix,
-- 		where process numbers are recycled).
--
-- 		When using "kill" Vim will assume the job will die and close
-- 		the channel.

-- 		For the use of {expr}, see |bufname()| above.
-- 		When the buffer or variable doesn't exist {def} or an empty

-- 		'suffixes' affect the ordering of matches.
-- 		'wildignorecase' always applies.
--
-- 		When {list} is present and it is |TRUE| the result is a List
-- 		with all matching files. The advantage of using a List is,
-- 		you also get filenames containing newlines correctly.
-- 		Otherwise the result is a String and when there are several
-- 		matches, they are separated by <NL> characters.
--
-- 		If the expansion fails, the result is an empty String or List.
--
-- 		You can also use |readdir()| if you need to do complicated

-- 			:let &tags = substitute(tagfiles, "\n", ",", "g")
-- <		The result of the program inside the backticks should be one

-- 		Examples: >
-- 			call filter(mylist, 'v:val !~ "OLD"')
-- <		Removes the items where "OLD" appears. >
-- 			call filter(mydict, 'v:key >= 8')
-- <		Removes the items with a key below 8. >
-- 			call filter(var, 0)
-- <		Removes all the items, thus clears the |List| or |Dictionary|.
--
-- 		Note that {expr2} is the result of expression and is then
-- 		used as an expression again.  Often it is good to use a
-- 		|literal-string| to avoid having to double backslashes.
--
-- 		If {expr2} is a |Funcref| it must take two arguments:
-- 			1. the key or the index of the current item.
-- 			2. the value of the current item.
-- 		The function must return |TRUE| if the item should be kept.
-- 		Example that keeps the odd items of a list: >
-- 			func Odd(idx, val)
-- 			  return a:idx % 2 == 1
-- 			endfunc
-- 			call filter(mylist, function('Odd'))
-- <		It is shorter when using a |lambda|: >
-- 			call filter(myList, {idx, val -> idx * val <= 42})
-- <		If you do not use "val" you can leave it out: >
-- 			call filter(myList, {idx -> idx % 2 == 1})
-- <
-- 		The operation is done in-place.  If you want a |List| or
-- 		|Dictionary| to remain unmodified make a copy first: >
-- 			:let l = filter(copy(mylist), 'v:val =~ "KEEP"')
--
-- <		Returns {expr1}, the |List| or |Dictionary| that was filtered.
-- 		When an error is encountered while evaluating {expr2} no
-- 		further items in {expr1} are processed. When {expr2} is a
-- 		Funcref errors inside a function are ignored, unless it was
-- 		defined with the "abort" flag.
--- @return list/dict
function vim.fn.filter(expr1, expr2) end

-- Deletes a previously defined sign {name}. This is similar to
-- 		the |:sign-undefine| command. If {name} is not supplied, then
-- 		deletes all the defined signs.
--
-- 		Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
--
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			" Delete a sign named mySign
-- 			call sign_undefine("mySign")
--
-- 			" Delete all the signs
-- 			call sign_undefine()
--- @return number
function vim.fn.sign_undefine(name) end

-- Write {msg} in the channel log file, if it was opened with
-- 		|ch_logfile()|.
-- 		When {handle} is passed the channel number is used for the
-- 		message.
-- 		{handle} can be a Channel or a Job that has a Channel.  The
-- 		Channel must be open for the channel number to be used.
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			'did something'->ch_log()
--- @return none
function vim.fn.ch_log(msg, handle) end

-- {expr1} must be a |List| or a |Dictionary|.
-- 		Replace each item in {expr1} with the result of evaluating
-- 		{expr2}. {expr2} must be a |string| or |Funcref|.
--
-- 		If {expr2} is a |string|, inside {expr2} |v:val| has the value
-- 		of the current item. For a |Dictionary| |v:key| has the key
-- 		of the current item and for a |List| |v:key| has the index of
-- 		the current item.
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:call map(mylist, '"> " . v:val . " <"')
-- <		This puts "> " before and " <" after each item in "mylist".
--
-- 		Note that {expr2} is the result of an expression and is then
-- 		used as an expression again.  Often it is good to use a
-- 		|literal-string| to avoid having to double backslashes.  You
-- 		still have to double ' quotes
--
-- 		If {expr2} is a |Funcref| it is called with two arguments:
-- 			1. The key or the index of the current item.
-- 			2. the value of the current item.
-- 		The function must return the new value of the item. Example
-- 		that changes each value by "key-value": >
-- 			func KeyValue(key, val)
-- 			  return a:key . '-' . a:val
-- 			endfunc
-- 			call map(myDict, function('KeyValue'))
-- <		It is shorter when using a |lambda|: >
-- 			call map(myDict, {key, val -> key . '-' . val})
-- <		If you do not use "val" you can leave it out: >
-- 			call map(myDict, {key -> 'item: ' . key})
-- <		If you do not use "key" you can use a short name: >
-- 			call map(myDict, {_, val -> 'item: ' . val})
-- <
-- 		The operation is done in-place.  If you want a |List| or
-- 		|Dictionary| to remain unmodified make a copy first: >
-- 			:let tlist = map(copy(mylist), ' v:val . "\t"')
--
-- <		Returns {expr1}, the |List| or |Dictionary| that was filtered.
-- 		When an error is encountered while evaluating {expr2} no
-- 		further items in {expr1} are processed. When {expr2} is a
-- 		Funcref errors inside a function are ignored, unless it was
-- 		defined with the "abort" flag.
--- @return list/dict
function vim.fn.map(expr1, expr2) end

-- Remove second and succeeding copies of repeated adjacent
-- 		{list} items in-place.  Returns {list}.  If you want a list
-- 		to remain unmodified make a copy first: >
-- 			:let newlist = uniq(copy(mylist))
-- <		The default compare function uses the string representation of
-- 		each item.  For the use of {func} and {dict} see |sort()|.
--- @param list any[]
--- @param dict dictionary
--- @return list
function vim.fn.uniq(list, func, dict) end

-- Check for a key typed while looking for completion matches.
-- 		This is to be used when looking for matches takes some time.
-- 		Returns |TRUE| when searching for matches is to be aborted,
-- 		zero otherwise.
-- 		Only to be used by the function specified with the
-- 		'completefunc' option.
--- @return number
function vim.fn.complete_check() end
