-- 	This gives the end-of-line (<EOL>) formats that will be tried when
-- 	starting to edit a new buffer and when reading a file into an existing
-- 	buffer:
-- 	- When empty, the format defined with 'fileformat' will be used
-- 	  always.  It is not set automatically.
-- 	- When set to one name, that format will be used whenever a new buffer
-- 	  is opened.  'fileformat' is set accordingly for that buffer.  The
-- 	  'fileformats' name will be used when a file is read into an existing
-- 	  buffer, no matter what 'fileformat' for that buffer is set to.
-- 	- When more than one name is present, separated by commas, automatic
-- 	  <EOL> detection will be done when reading a file.  When starting to
-- 	  edit a file, a check is done for the <EOL>:
-- 	  1. If all lines end in <CR><NL>, and 'fileformats' includes "dos",
-- 	     'fileformat' is set to "dos".
-- 	  2. If a <NL> is found and 'fileformats' includes "unix", 'fileformat'
-- 	     is set to "unix".  Note that when a <NL> is found without a
-- 	     preceding <CR>, "unix" is preferred over "dos".
-- 	  3. If 'fileformat' has not yet been set, and if a <CR> is found, and
-- 	     if 'fileformats' includes "mac", 'fileformat' is set to "mac".
-- 	     This means that "mac" is only chosen when:
-- 	      "unix" is not present or no <NL> is found in the file, and
-- 	      "dos" is not present or no <CR><NL> is found in the file.
-- 	     Except: if "unix" was chosen, but there is a <CR> before
-- 	     the first <NL>, and there appear to be more <CR>s than <NL>s in
-- 	     the first few lines, "mac" is used.
-- 	  4. If 'fileformat' is still not set, the first name from
-- 	     'fileformats' is used.
-- 	  When reading a file into an existing buffer, the same is done, but
-- 	  this happens like 'fileformat' has been set appropriately for that

-- 		started with a file name argument, the buffer list is not
-- 		restored.  If Vim is started without a file name argument, the
-- 		buffer list is restored from the shada file.  Quickfix
-- 		('buftype'), unlisted ('buflisted'), unnamed and buffers on
-- 		removable media (|shada-r|) are not saved.
-- 		When followed by a number, the number specifies the maximum
-- 		number of buffers that are stored.  Without a number all
-- 		buffers are stored.
-- 							*shada-'*
-- 	'	Maximum number of previously edited files for which the marks
-- 		are remembered.  This parameter must always be included when
-- 		'shada' is non-empty.
-- 		Including this item also means that the |jumplist| and the
-- 		|changelist| are stored in the shada file.
-- 							*shada-/*
-- 	/	Maximum number of items in the search pattern history to be
-- 		saved.  If non-zero, then the previous search and substitute
-- 		patterns are also saved.  When not included, the value of
-- 		'history' is used.
-- 							*shada-:*
-- 	:	Maximum number of items in the command-line history to be
-- 		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
-- 							*shada-<*
-- 	<	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  If zero then
-- 		registers are not saved.  When not included, all lines are
-- 		saved.  '"' is the old name for this item.
-- 		Also see the 's' item below: limit specified in KiB.
-- 							*shada-@*
-- 	@	Maximum number of items in the input-line history to be
-- 		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
-- 							*shada-c*
-- 	c	Dummy option, kept for compatibility reasons.  Has no actual
-- 		effect: ShaDa always uses UTF-8 and 'encoding' value is fixed
-- 		to UTF-8 as well.
-- 							*shada-f*
-- 	f	Whether file marks need to be stored.  If zero, file marks ('0
-- 		to '9, 'A to 'Z) are not stored.  When not present or when
-- 		non-zero, they are all stored.  '0 is used for the current
-- 		cursor position (when exiting or when doing |:wshada|).
-- 							*shada-h*
-- 	h	Disable the effect of 'hlsearch' when loading the shada
-- 		file.  When not included, it depends on whether ":nohlsearch"
-- 		has been used since the last search command.
-- 							*shada-n*
-- 	n	Name of the shada file.  The name must immediately follow
-- 		the 'n'.  Must be at the end of the option!  If the
-- 		'shadafile' option is set, that file name overrides the one
-- 		given here with 'shada'.  Environment variables are
-- 		expanded when opening the file, not when setting the option.
-- 							*shada-r*
-- 	r	Removable media.  The argument is a string (up to the next
-- 		',').  This parameter can be given several times.  Each
-- 		specifies the start of a path for which no marks will be
-- 		stored.  This is to avoid removable media.  For Windows you
-- 		could use "ra:,rb:".  You can also use it for temp files,
-- 		e.g., for Unix: "r/tmp".  Case is ignored.
-- 							*shada-s*
-- 	s	Maximum size of an item contents in KiB.  If zero then nothing
-- 		is saved.  Unlike Vim this applies to all items, except for
-- 		the buffer list and header.  Full item size is off by three
-- 		unsigned integers: with `s10` maximum item size may be 1 byte
-- 		(type: 7-bit integer) + 9 bytes (timestamp: up to 64-bit
-- 		integer) + 3 bytes (item size: up to 16-bit integer because
-- 		2^8 < 10240 < 2^16) + 10240 bytes (requested maximum item
-- 		contents size) = 10253 bytes.
