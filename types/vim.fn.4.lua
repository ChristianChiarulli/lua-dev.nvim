-- 			curscol	cursor screen column
-- 		If the specified position is not visible, all values are zero.
-- 		The "endcol" value differs from "col" when the character

-- 		be 1 and "endcol" can be 8.
-- 		The "curscol" value is where the cursor would be placed.  For

-- 		{col} is 1 for the leftmost column, {lnum} is 1 for the first

--
-- 		Does not change the jumplist.
-- 		If {lnum} is greater than the number of lines in the buffer,

-- 			"fail"	job failed to start
-- 			"dead"	job died or was stopped after running
--
-- 		On Unix a non-existing command results in "dead" instead of

-- 			static		A file specific tag.  Refer to

-- 		More entries may be present, depending on the content of the
-- 		tags file: access, implementation, inherits and signature.
-- 		Refer to the ctags documentation for information about these
-- 		fields.  For C code the fields "struct", "class" and "enum"
-- 		may appear, they give the name of the entity the tag is

--
-- 		If there are no matching tags, then an empty list is returned.

-- 		See |sign-group|.
--
-- 		Each list item in the returned value is a dictionary with the
-- 		following entries:
-- 			bufnr	number of the buffer with the sign
-- 			signs	list of signs placed in {bufnr}. Each list

-- 			name	name of the defined sign
-- 			priority	sign priority

-- 		Number zero is the alternate buffer for the current window.
-- 		If {expr} is a String, it is used as a |file-pattern| to match
-- 		with the buffer names.  This is always done like 'magic' is
-- 		set and 'cpoptions' is empty.  When there is more than one
-- 		match an empty string is returned.
-- 		"" or "%" can be used for the current buffer, "#" for the
-- 		alternate buffer.
-- 		A full match is preferred, otherwise a match at the start, end
-- 		or middle of the buffer name is accepted.  If you only want a
-- 		full match then put "^" at the start and "$" at the end of the
-- 		pattern.
-- 		Listed buffers are found first.  If there is a single match
-- 		with a listed buffer, that one is returned.  Next unlisted
-- 		buffers are searched for.
-- 		If the {expr} is a String, but you want to use it as a buffer
-- 		number, force it to be a Number by adding zero to it: >

-- 		However, at least one of stdin, stdout or stderr must be
-- 		connected to the terminal.  When I/O is connected to the
-- 		terminal then the callback function for that part is not used.

-- 		   "term_rows"	     vertical size to use for the terminal,

-- 		   "vertical"	     split the window vertically; note that

-- 					"open": open window if needed
-- 				     Note that "open" can be interruptive.
-- 				     See |term++close| and |term++open|.
-- 		   "term_opencmd"    command to use for opening the window when
-- 				     "open" is used for "term_finish"; must
-- 				     have "%d" where the buffer number goes,
-- 				     e.g. "10split|buffer %d"; when not
-- 				     specified "botright sbuf %d" is used
-- 		   "eof_chars"	     Text to send after all buffer lines were
-- 				     written to the terminal.  When not set
-- 				     CTRL-D is used on MS-Windows. For Python
-- 				     use CTRL-Z or "exit()". For a shell use
-- 				     "exit".  A CR is always added.
-- 		   "ansi_colors"     A list of 16 color names or hex codes
-- 				     defining the ANSI palette used in GUI
-- 				     color modes.  See |g:terminal_ansi_colors|.
-- 		   "tty_type"	     (MS-Windows only): Specify which pty to
-- 				     use.  See 'termwintype' for the values.

-- Return a string which contains characters indicating the
-- 		current state.  Mostly useful in callbacks that want to do
-- 		work that may not always be safe.  Roughly this works like:
-- 		- callback uses state() to check if work is safe to do.
-- 		  Yes: then do it right away.
-- 		  No:  add to work queue and add a |SafeState| and/or
-- 		       |SafeStateAgain| autocommand (|SafeState| triggers at
-- 		       toplevel, |SafeStateAgain| triggers after handling
-- 		       messages and callbacks).
-- 		- When SafeState or SafeStateAgain is triggered and executes
-- 		  your autocommand, check with `state()` if the work can be
-- 		  done now, and if yes remove it from the queue and execute.
-- 		  Remove the autocommand if the queue is now empty.
-- 		Also see |mode()|.
--
-- 		When {what} is given only characters in this string will be
-- 		added.  E.g, this checks if the screen has scrolled: >
-- 			if state('s') == ''
-- 			   " screen has not scrolled
-- <
-- 		These characters indicate the state, generally indicating that
-- 		something is busy:
-- 		    m	halfway a mapping, :normal command, feedkeys() or
-- 			stuffed command
-- 		    o	operator pending or waiting for a command argument,
-- 		        e.g. after |f|
-- 		    a	Insert mode autocomplete active
-- 		    x	executing an autocommand
-- 		    w	blocked on waiting, e.g. ch_evalexpr(), ch_read() and
-- 			ch_readraw() when reading json.
-- 		    S	not triggering SafeState or SafeStateAgain
-- 		    c	callback invoked, including timer (repeats for
-- 			recursiveness up to "ccc")
-- 		    s	screen has scrolled for messages
--- @return string
function vim.fn.state(what) end

-- Return the current character search information as a {dict}
-- 		with the following entries:
--
-- 		    char	character previously used for a character
-- 				search (|t|, |f|, |T|, or |F|); empty string
-- 				if no character search has been performed
-- 		    forward	direction of character search; 1 for forward,
-- 				0 for backward
-- 		    until	type of character search; 1 for a |t| or |T|
-- 				character search, 0 for an |f| or |F|
-- 				character search
--
-- 		This can be useful to always have |;| and |,| search
-- 		forward/backward regardless of the direction of the previous
-- 		character search: >
-- 			:nnoremap <expr> ; getcharsearch().forward ? ';' : ','
-- 			:nnoremap <expr> , getcharsearch().forward ? ',' : ';'

-- This function checks if an executable with the name {expr}
-- 		exists.  {expr} must be the name of the program without any
-- 		arguments.
-- 		executable() uses the value of $PATH and/or the normal
-- 		searchpath for programs.		*PATHEXT*
-- 		On Windows the ".exe", ".bat", etc. can
-- 		optionally be included.  Then the extensions in $PATHEXT are
-- 		tried.  Thus if "foo.exe" does not exist, "foo.exe.bat" can be
-- 		found.  If $PATHEXT is not set then ".exe;.com;.bat;.cmd" is
-- 		used.  A dot by itself can be used in $PATHEXT to try using
-- 		the name without an extension.  When 'shell' looks like a
-- 		Unix shell, then the name is also tried without adding an
-- 		extension.
-- 		On Windows it only checks if the file exists and
-- 		is not a directory, not if it's really executable.
-- 		On Windows an executable in the same directory as Vim is
-- 		always found (it is added to $PATH at |startup|).
-- 		The result is a Number:
-- 			1	exists
-- 			0	does not exist
-- 			-1	not implemented on this system
-- 		|exepath()| can be used to get the full path of an executable.

-- Perform glob() on all directories in {path} and concatenate

-- <
-- 		{path} is a comma-separated list of directory names.  Each
-- 		directory name is prepended to {expr} and expanded like with
-- 		|glob()|.  A path separator is inserted when needed.
-- 		To add a comma inside a directory name escape it with a
-- 		backslash.  Note that on MS-Windows a directory may have a
-- 		trailing backslash, remove it if you put a comma after it.
-- 		If the expansion fails for one of the directories, there is no
-- 		error message.
--
-- 		Unless the optional {nosuf} argument is given and is |TRUE|,
-- 		the 'suffixes' and 'wildignore' options apply: Names matching
-- 		one of the patterns in 'wildignore' will be skipped and
-- 		'suffixes' affect the ordering of matches.
--
-- 		When {list} is present and it is |TRUE| the result is a List
-- 		with all matching files. The advantage of using a List is, you
-- 		also get filenames containing newlines correctly. Otherwise
-- 		the result is a String and when there are several matches,
-- 		they are separated by <NL> characters.  Example: >
-- 			:echo globpath(&rtp, "syntax/c.vim", 0, 1)
-- <
-- 		{allinks} is used as with |glob()|.
--
-- 		The "**" item can be used to search in a directory tree.
-- 		For example, to find all "README.txt" files in the directories
-- 		in 'runtimepath' and below: >
-- 			:echo globpath(&rtp, "**/README.txt")
-- <		Upwards search and limiting the depth of "**" is not
-- 		supported, thus using 'path' will not always work properly.
