-- 	CHAR	VALUE	~
-- 							*shada-!*
-- 	!	When included, save and restore global variables that start
-- 		with an uppercase letter, and don't contain a lowercase
-- 		letter.  Thus "KEEPTHIS and "K_L_M" are stored, but "KeepThis"
-- 		and "_K_L_M" are not.  Nested List and Dict items may not be
-- 		read back correctly, you end up with an empty item.
-- 							*shada-quote*
-- 	"	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  Old name of
-- 		the '<' item, with the disadvantage that you need to put a
-- 		backslash before the ", otherwise it will be recognized as the
-- 		start of a comment!
-- 							*shada-%*
-- 	%	When included, save and restore the buffer list.  If Vim is
-- 		started with a file name argument, the buffer list is not
-- 		restored.  If Vim is started without a file name argument, the
-- 		buffer list is restored from the shada file.  Quickfix
-- 		('buftype'), unlisted ('buflisted'), unnamed and buffers on
-- 		removable media (|shada-r|) are not saved.
-- 		When followed by a number, the number specifies the maximum
-- 		number of buffers that are stored.  Without a number all
-- 		buffers are stored.
-- 							*shada-'*
-- 	'	Maximum number of previously edited files for which the marks
-- 		are remembered.  This parameter must always be included when
-- 		'shada' is non-empty.
-- 		Including this item also means that the |jumplist| and the
-- 		|changelist| are stored in the shada file.
-- 							*shada-/*
-- 	/	Maximum number of items in the search pattern history to be
-- 		saved.  If non-zero, then the previous search and substitute
-- 		patterns are also saved.  When not included, the value of
-- 		'history' is used.
-- 							*shada-:*
-- 	:	Maximum number of items in the command-line history to be
-- 		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
-- 							*shada-<*
-- 	<	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  If zero then
-- 		registers are not saved.  When not included, all lines are
-- 		saved.  '"' is the old name for this item.
-- 		Also see the 's' item below: limit specified in KiB.
-- 							*shada-@*
-- 	@	Maximum number of items in the input-line history to be
-- 		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
-- 							*shada-c*
-- 	c	Dummy option, kept for compatibility reasons.  Has no actual
-- 		effect: ShaDa always uses UTF-8 and 'encoding' value is fixed
-- 		to UTF-8 as well.
-- 							*shada-f*
-- 	f	Whether file marks need to be stored.  If zero, file marks ('0
-- 		to '9, 'A to 'Z) are not stored.  When not present or when
-- 		non-zero, they are all stored.  '0 is used for the current
-- 		cursor position (when exiting or when doing |:wshada|).
-- 							*shada-h*
-- 	h	Disable the effect of 'hlsearch' when loading the shada
-- 		file.  When not included, it depends on whether ":nohlsearch"
-- 		has been used since the last search command.
-- 							*shada-n*
-- 	n	Name of the shada file.  The name must immediately follow
-- 		the 'n'.  Must be at the end of the option!  If the
-- 		'shadafile' option is set, that file name overrides the one
-- 		given here with 'shada'.  Environment variables are
-- 		expanded when opening the file, not when setting the option.
-- 							*shada-r*
-- 	r	Removable media.  The argument is a string (up to the next
-- 		',').  This parameter can be given several times.  Each
-- 		specifies the start of a path for which no marks will be
-- 		stored.  This is to avoid removable media.  For Windows you
-- 		could use "ra:,rb:".  You can also use it for temp files,
-- 		e.g., for Unix: "r/tmp".  Case is ignored.
-- 							*shada-s*
-- 	s	Maximum size of an item contents in KiB.  If zero then nothing
-- 		is saved.  Unlike Vim this applies to all items, except for
-- 		the buffer list and header.  Full item size is off by three
-- 		unsigned integers: with `s10` maximum item size may be 1 byte
-- 		(type: 7-bit integer) + 9 bytes (timestamp: up to 64-bit
-- 		integer) + 3 bytes (item size: up to 16-bit integer because
-- 		2^8 < 10240 < 2^16) + 10240 bytes (requested maximum item
-- 		contents size) = 10253 bytes.

-- 	including spaces and backslashes).
-- 	See 'wildignore' for completely ignoring files.

-- 	   useopen	If included, jump to the first open window that
-- 			contains the specified buffer (if there is one).
-- 			Otherwise: Do not examine other windows.
-- 			This setting is checked with |quickfix| commands, when
-- 			jumping to errors (":cc", ":cn", "cp", etc.).  It is
-- 			also used in all buffer related split commands, for
-- 			example ":sbuffer", ":sbnext", or ":sbrewind".
-- 	   usetab	Like "useopen", but also consider windows in other tab
-- 			pages.
-- 	   split	If included, split the current window before loading
-- 			a buffer for a |quickfix| command that display errors.
-- 			Otherwise: do not split, use current window (when used
-- 			in the quickfix window: the previously used window or
-- 			split if there is no other window).
-- 	   vsplit	Just like "split" but split vertically.
-- 	   newtab	Like "split", but open a new tab page.  Overrules
-- 			"split" when both are present.
-- 	   uselast	If included, jump to the previously used window when
-- 			jumping to errors with |quickfix| commands.
